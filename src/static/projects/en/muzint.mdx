**MuzInt** is a service for real-time offline events themed around guessing the order of artists playing in a bar.

Administrators have a web panel with role-based access, implemented via JWT and Refresh tokens. In the admin panel it is possible to both manage user roles, create, delete games, and manage ongoing events in real time: change the current round, show results, etc.

During a game, users choose the order of playing tracks and see their results.

The architecture of the project is designed in such a way that in the future it will be easy to add personal player accounts and expand the functionality of the service.
