**FontNET** is an AI-driven platform that enables seamless translation of custom fonts from Latin to Cyrillic scripts. Designed with usability in mind, **FontNET** serves designers, linguists, and content creators who need to adapt fonts for multilingual audiences while preserving their unique stylistic elements.

In this project, I worked collaboratively with a team consisting of three AI engineers, two front-ends and a team lead, using Git for version control and adhering to Agile methodologies to manage our workflow and iterations efficiently. My primary responsibility was developing the front-end application, creating an intuitive interface that allows users to explore **FontNETâ€™s** features, upload their custom fonts, and retrieve the translated versions after processing. The front end was built with a focus on simplicity and user experience, enabling a streamlined journey from upload to download.

To support the functionality between the front end and the AI model, I also developed an intermediate API. This API handles user requests, manages the communication between the front end and the AI model, and implements a caching mechanism to store previously translated fonts, reducing processing times for repeat users and optimizing the overall user experience.
