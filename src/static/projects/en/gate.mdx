**Gate** is a unique Windows application designed as an invisible browser for seamless use during screen recordings and screenshots, staying hidden while allowing users to browse without interruption. The application includes essential productivity features, such as the ability to hide the app instantly with a hotkey, auto-mute for all tabs, and more.

To support **Gateâ€™s** subscription management and user administration, I developed a full-stack web application with a role-based authentication system and tiered subscription options. This web app enables users to manage their active subscriptions, check the status of their licenses across multiple devices, and track activation details like activation history and expiration dates.

For administrators, the web app includes a powerful control panel where they can generate new subscription keys, manage existing keys, and access detailed user information. This streamlined, role-specific interface enhances the overall user and admin experience, ensuring both simplicity for users and control for administrators.
