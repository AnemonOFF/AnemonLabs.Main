**Obana Club** is a web application designed for a business that organizes offline events across various vibrant locations. The platform enables users to explore upcoming events by selecting their city and country, with automatic location detection available for ease of use. Users can view detailed event information, including venue, date, time, cost, and availability. The app also provides options to register for events, submit a request to join a team if they are unassigned, and send inquiries about franchises or custom corporate events.

To support event and request management, I developed a comprehensive admin interface with role-based access. This feature allows administrators to view, manage, and respond to requests based on their assigned cities and roles. Additionally, admins can access the entire event history, create new events, and update existing ones, ensuring the app stays current and relevant for each locale.
