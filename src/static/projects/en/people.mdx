**People** is a web application developed to provide companies with a tailored bonus system for employee motivation and engagement. I worked as both team lead and full-stack developer, collaborating closely with a front-end developer and an analyst to bring this project to life.

The **People** app offers employees the opportunity to redeem their accumulated bonuses for a variety of products made available by administrators. Users can browse the product catalog, place orders, and even use their bonus balance externally through QR codes at partner locations associated with the company.

For administrators, the app provides robust tools to manage and optimize the bonus system. They can allocate additional bonuses to users, create and manage teams with shared balances that can be distributed among team members, add or update products in the catalog, and oversee and update user orders. This role-based functionality ensures a streamlined experience for both users and administrators, making **People** a versatile platform for fostering workplace motivation through a customizable reward system.
